# variables are containers used to label and store the values for future reference
price = 5 # price is the variable here

# delete variables: del keyword will permanently remve variables and other objects
del price
print(price)  # It will say price is not defined

# Track variables: To see all the varibales in your code- we have %who and %whose in jupyter notebook, but in visual studio code you can use globals(), locals(), dir()
