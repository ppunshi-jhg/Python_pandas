# int, float, bool, list, set etc

# Type function- type() function is used to print the data type of the value

print(type("123"))

# type conversion- is to convert the data type from one to another, but you cant convert everything, see below for examples

print(int("123"))    #this can be converted easily
# print(int("abc"))  this cant be converted to integer

# Iterables: are data types which can be iterated, or looped through, allowing you to move from one value to the next- like strings, list etc

# Mutable: A data type is mutable if it can be modified after its creation
# Mutable data type: List, disctionary, sets
# Immutable: Integers, floats, strings, bool, tuples
